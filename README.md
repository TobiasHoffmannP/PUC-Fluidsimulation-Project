# PUC Fluid Simulation Project
## Description
    This projects aimts to create a 2D Stokes solver without using existing simulation libraries like FEniCSx. 
    To create the domain, we used the open source software Triangle to create triangle mesh containing a squirmer in the middle. 

## Goals
 - Create a 2D Fluid simulation (Stokes solver) from the ground up
 - Investigate most optimal squirmer boundary conditions to stir surrounding water to enable most consumption of food
